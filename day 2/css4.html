        <h3>Navier was the perfect empress, however, the Emperor wanted a wife, not a colleague. And so, the Emperor abandoned Empress Navier and placed a slave girl beside him. That was fine, until Navier heard the Emperor promise the slave girl the Empressâ€™ position. After much agonizing, Navier decided she would remarry the emperor of the neighboring country.</h3>
